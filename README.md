# Todo templates

I wanted to create various web apps templates that use various tech stacks. I've started with Go for the backend and
ReactJS for the frontend. Future versions will include other tech stacks such as python, nodejs, etc.

## Usage

The todo web app is already dockerized, so it's a matter of running the following command:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/repo
$ docker compose up
```
